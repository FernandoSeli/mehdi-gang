Current Workout Cycle Plan

- In WorkoutDetails screen, users are able to add new entries for each exercise. This means the "New Session" page is scrapped.
- You will have to allow the user to edit past workout datas.
- A workout data will not hold its exercises track data, as..
- ..each Exercise will have its own track array data.
- New Workout screen remains separate. 
- TodayWorkout's button will redirect the user today's WorkoutDetails screen.
- Pretty urgent: find a way to incorporate techniques such as supersets, dropsets, back-off sets, warmups, etc.
