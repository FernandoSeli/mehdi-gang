# Adept - a lightweight, reliable and flexible fitness progression app.

[!] This project is still in early development. To summarize, MVP is not available yet but most front-end and user interface components are ready. Attached below are some screenshots of the app, but nothing is final.

Most of the fitness tracking apps on both the iOS and Android platforms less a tool but more a chore. They have one common issue: flexibility. While they aim to ease users by providing a sort of database for available exercises, this can be counter-intuitive as users are forced to only select the exercises and format provided by the database itself. Moreover, most apps does not account variability such that a person might change a workout dynamically throughout its cycle. These advanced techniques require flexibility in storing the workout data, and this is what this application aim to tackle. With Adept, we will ensure gym-goers all the tool they need to track their workouts effectively without gimmicks.

This project is written on TypeScript using React Native, Firebase and TypeORM frameworks.
